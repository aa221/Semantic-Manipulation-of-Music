## Instructions ##

1) 
Run get instrumentation.py which will populate a folder with the generated midis. 

You might need to download some files in order to run the instrumentation.py found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z8oW16dZtdS06woHc7_rxserNJRrkc4s and place these in the static folder of chorderator/static

Just download the ones that say "cannot find file path."


2) In order to run the classifier in classify.py you'll need to create replicate credentials: replicate.com. You'll store them in a file here: AccoMontage2/replicate_credentials.json.
